# DNAPrintingPipeline

To run this code, download/clone the current directory, in the current directory, enter in the terminal `python -i imageToPrimerPairs.py`, and then inside python, type `primerPairInfoList()`. This will let you know the primer pairs for each lane to generate a certain graph on gel.

If you wish to change the input picture, move the picture into the current directory, rename, and make that an object in imageToPrimerPairs.py, change code accordingly.

The image analysis part of thie pipeline is done with the generous help of [Bowen](https://github.com/JiangBowen0008). Some source files are from [Roya](https://github.com/ramininaieni) and [Max](https://github.com/maxschommer).



Note: there's a small math thing in need of being fixed.
